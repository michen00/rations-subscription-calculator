# 🐾 Rations Subscription Calculator

**Plan your pet food subscription orders efficiently!**

## 🎯 Why This Exists

I was planning my Chewy subscription order. I got my cans and toppers lined up but couldn't order it 'every 24 days'; my custom pallet came in a 24 pack, but the subscription options were 1-16 weeks or 5-8 months. I wanted efficient subscription orders but didn't want to spend too much in one go. So I built this little calculator with Claude Opus 4.5.
